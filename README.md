# Automatic Speech Analysis for Detection of Parkinsonâ€™s Disease using X-Vector Speech Representations

This is for the course TFE4940 Electronic Systems Design and Innovation, Master's Thesis at NTNU, by Duyen Kim Le.

This git repository contains code for the thesis which explores an automatic detection of PD based on speech analysis by utilizing x-vector speech representations from both a pre-trained and custom-trained x-vector model from SpeechBrain.
